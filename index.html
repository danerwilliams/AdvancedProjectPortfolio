            <p>
                Welcome to my portfolio for Advanced Projects 2016-2017 at Eastside Catholic! 
                Advanced Projects is a class available to students who have completed AP Computer Science, 
                and involves independently pursuing computer science related projects. The following portfolio
                includes the work that I have done in this class.

        <h3><a name="ARProjectPhase1">AR Project Phase 1</h3>
        <p>
            Phase 1 of the AR project was research oriented. The goal of the AR project was to create a form for the Academic Resources department 
            at Eastside Catholic, which would automate the process students, teachers, and AR staff go through to set up testing with accommodations 
            at school. The original process involved the student going to the AR classroom to grab a form, then the student would fill out the form 
            with their name, the class, period, teacher, and requested accommodations for the specified test. After filling out the form, the student 
            would then need to get the teacher to sign the form, give the form back to the student, so that the student could give the form to AR, 
            who would then organize the form with the many others by hand. My project aimed to create a website which would make this process much 
            more efficient and convenient for the AR staff, teachers, and students.

            Resources:
            <br>    Microsoft Outlook Calendar REST API
            <br>    Java
            <br>    Servlet / Tomcat
            <br>    JSP
            <br>    Maven
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion:<br>
            By the end of the research phase of the AR Project had developed skills which I did not previously have in REST API's, HTTP protocol, 
            servlet, tomcat, jsp, and maven. Most importantly I had developed a clear idea of how I would approach creating the application after 
            developing a greater understanding of how web applications work, particularly those written with java and jsp.

        <h3><a name="PebbleSmartwatch">Pebble Smartwatch</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of the pebble smartwatch (now owned by fitbit) project was to create two watch faces for Pebble OS, one with C and another 
            with Java Script.
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources:
            <br>    Java Script
            <br>    C
            <br>    Pebble IDE 
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion:<br>
            After completing the pebble smartwatch project, I had developed a fundamental understanding of C and Java Script, and how to use 
            these to develop a smartwatch watch face.

        <h3><a name="ARProjectPhase2">AR Project Phase 2</h3>
        <p>
            Phase two of the AR Project involved building the application on a level of local functionality. I used eclipse to develop a Maven webapp 
            that would utilize Unirest to make calls to the outlook REST API. By the end of this phase I had an application which worked on a local 
            server such as Tomcat running on port 8080. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources:
            <br>    Tomcat
            <br>    Eclipse 
            <br>    Maven (webapp)
            <br>    Outlook REST API
            <br>    Unirest External Java Library
            <br>    JSP
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion:<br>
            Creating the AR Project allowed me to significantly expand my knowledge of Java from being limited to an AP CS level, to including JSP, 
            Maven, and using external libraries particularly for http protocol.

        <h3><a name="Swift3">Swift 3</h3>
        <p>
            In order to build on my object oriented programming knowledge from being limited to Java and C#, I completed the XCode guided tour 
            of Swift 3. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources:<br>
            <br>    XCode
            <br>    Swift 3
            <br>    Mac OSX
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion:<br>
            Introducing myself to Swift 3 made me more familiar with object oriented programming in a different syntax and style than Java or C#.

        <h3><a name="ARProjectPhase3">AR Project Phase 3</h3>
        <p>
            Phase 3 of the AR Project was the third and final phase of the project. This involved deploying the application so that it can be used 
            by Academic Resources and their students. Over the course of this phase, many deployement options were experiemented with, including 
            many options available on a local server sucha as Apache and IIS, but eventually it was deployed in the cloud with Amazon Web Services. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources:<br>
            <br>    Amazon Web Services EC2 Elastic Beanstalk
            <br>
            <br>
            Conclusion:<br>
            In phase 3 of the AR project I became very familiar with the multitude of deployment options available for web applications, as I 
            had around 3 months of trial and error attempting to deploy my application. Eventually, I settled on a cloud service, specifically from 
            Amazon, for its superiority to a personal server in convenience and scalability, especially compared to a local server run on a restricted 
            school network. Additionally, I made small design changes to the application itself as I learned how certain elements can be more optimal 
            for deployement in a cloud based web service.
